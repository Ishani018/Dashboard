How It Works:
Data Fetching: Done in DashboardPage.jsx using useEffect on mount

Dynamic Tabs: Extracts all API keys ending in Data (e.g., tab1Data, tab2Data) to generate dynamic tabs

Sidebar: Reads sidebarData and displays recent violations and activities

GaugeChart:
        Renders only in tab2
        Dynamically adjusts its max value based on the highest incoming data point# Dashboard
